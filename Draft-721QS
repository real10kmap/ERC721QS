## Abstract

This is a standard for liquidity and security 721 tokens. 

## Motivation

Liquidity and security is the most important requirement in crypto which ERC721 is lack for some reasons. 
We research on ERC721 and our scenarios, extend two attributes and some rules to improve the liquidity and security of all ERC721 tokens.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every [EIP-721qs](./eip-721qs.md) compliant contract must implement the EIP-721qs, EIP-721 and [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) interfaces**

Some extend attributes' enumeration extension is OPTIONAL. This allows your contract to publish its full features of ERC721qs.

The slot level approval is OPTIONAL. This allows any contract that wants to support approval for slots, which allows an operator to manage one's tokens with the same slot.

```solidity

### EIP-721qs Token Receiver

If a smart contract wants to be informed when they receive values from other addresses, it should implement all of the functions in the `IERC721qsReceiver` interface, in the implementation it can decide whether to accept or reject the transfer. See "Transfer Rules" for further detail.

```solidity
 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title EIP-3525 token receiver interface
 * @dev Interface for a smart contract that wants to be informed by EIP-3525 contracts when receiving values from ANY addresses or EIP-3525 tokens.
 * Note: the EIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0x009ce20b.
 */
interface IERC3525Receiver {
    /**
     * @notice Handle the receipt of an EIP-3525 token value.
     * @dev An EIP-3525 smart contract MUST check whether this function is implemented by the recipient contract, if the
     *  recipient contract implements this function, the EIP-3525 contract MUST call this function after a 
     *  value transfer (i.e. `transferFrom(uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)`).
     *  MUST return 0x009ce20b (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256('onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,
     *  uint256,bytes)'))`) if the transfer is accepted.
     *  MUST revert or return any value other than 0x009ce20b if the transfer is rejected.
     * @param _operator The address which triggered the transfer
     * @param _fromTokenId The token id to transfer value from
     * @param _toTokenId The token id to transfer value to
     * @param _value The transferred value
     * @param _data Additional data with no specified format
     * @return `bytes4(keccak256('onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)'))` 
     *  unless the transfer is rejected.
     */

}
```

### Token Liquidity
这里要给出2-3三个最典型场景实例，要有图，新旧对比和新流程的
结合具体代码的方法

#### Scenarios

**_Transfer:_**

Besides EIP-721 compatible token transfer methods, this EIP introduces two new transfer models: value transfer from ID to ID, and value transfer from ID to address.

```solidity
function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value) external payable;
	
function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value) external payable returns (uint256 toTokenId_);
```

The first one allows value transfers from one token (specified by `_fromTokenId`) to another token (specified by `_toTokenId`) within the same slot, resulting in the `_value` being subtracted from the value of the source token and added to the value of the destination token; 

The second one allows value transfers from one token (specified by `_fromTokenId`) to an address (specified by `_to`), the value is actually transferred to a token owned by the address, and the id of the destination token should be returned. Further explanation can be found in the 'design decision' section for this method.

#### Rules

**_approving rules:_**

This EIP provides four kinds of approving functions indicating different levels of approvals, which can be described as full level approval, slot level approval, token ID level approval as well as value level approval.

- `setApprovalForAll`, compatible with EIP-721, SHOULD indicate the full level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens, including their values, owned by the owner.
- `setApprovalForSlot` (optional) SHOULD indicate the slot level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens with the specified slot, including their values, owned by the owner.
- The token ID level `approve` function, compatible with EIP-721, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing only the specified token ID, including its value, owned by the owner.
- The value level `approve` function, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing the specified maximum value of the specified token owned by the owner.
- For any approving function, the caller MUST be the owner or has been approved with a higher level of authority.

**_transferFrom rules:_**

- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value)` function, SHOULD indicate value transfers from one token to another token, in accordance with the rules below:

  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` or `_toTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
  - MUST revert if slots of `_fromTokenId` and `_toTokenId` do not match.
  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
  - MUST check for the `onERC721qsReceived` function if the owner of _toTokenId is a smart contract, if the function exists, MUST call this function after the value transfer, MUST revert if the result is not equal to 0x009ce20b;
  - MUST emit `TransferValue` event.

- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value)` function, which transfers value from one token ID to an address, SHOULD follow the rule below:

  - MUST either find a EIP-721qs token owned by the address `_to` or create a new EIP-721qs token, with the same slot of `_fromTokenId`, to receive the transferred value.
  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
  - MUST revert if `_to` is zero address.
  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
  - MUST check for the `onERC721qsReceived` function if the _to address is a smart contract, if the function exists, MUST call this function after the value transfer, MUST revert if the result is not equal to 0x009ce20b;
  - MUST emit `Transfer` and `TransferValue` events.

#### Metadata Extensions

EIP-721qs metadata extensions are compatible EIP-721 metadata extensions.

This optional interface can be identified with the EIP-165 Standard Interface Detection.

 * @dev Interfaces for any contract that wants to support query of the Uniform Resource Identifier
 *  (URI) for the EIP-3525 contract as well as a specified slot. 
 *  Because of the higher reliability of data stored in smart contracts compared to data stored in 
 *  centralized systems, it is recommended that metadata, including `contractURI`, `slotURI` and 
 *  `tokenURI`, be directly returned in JSON format, instead of being returned with a url pointing 
 *  to any resource stored in a centralized system. 
 *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525
 * Note: the EIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0xe1600902.

## Rationale
一些理论的分析和说明，要讲清楚逻辑
设计目标和设计决策分析
### Metadata generation

This token standard is designed to represent semi-fungible assets, which are most suited for financial instruments rather than collectibles or in-game items. For maximum transparency and safety of digital assets, we strongly recommend that all implementations should generate metadata directly from contract code rather than giving out an off-chain server URL.

### Design decision: Value transfer from token to address

### Design decision: Notification/acceptance mechanism instead of 'Safe Transfer'

### Design decision: Relationship between different approval models

For semantic compatibility with EIP-721 as well as the flexibility of value manipulation of tokens, we decided to define the relationships between some of the levels of approval like that:

1. Approval of an id will lead to the ability to partially transfer values from this id by the approved operator, this will simplify the value approval for an id. However, the approval of total values in a token should not lead to the ability to transfer the token entity by the approved operator.
2. `setApprovalForAll` will lead to the ability to partially transfer values from any token, as well as the ability to approve partial transfer of values from any token to a third party, this will simplify the value transfer and approval of all tokens owned by an address.

## Backwards Compatibility

As mentioned in the beginning, this EIP is backward compatible with EIP-721.

## Reference Implementation

- [EIP-721qs implementation](../assets/eip-721qs/contracts/ERC721qs.sol)

## Security Considerations
安全部分分析

The value level approval and slot level approval(optional) is isolated from EIP-721 approval models, so that approving value should not affect EIP-721 level approvals, implementations of this EIP must obey this principle.

Since this EIP is EIP-721 compatible, any wallets and smart contracts that can hold and manipulate standard EIP-721 tokens will have no risks of asset loss for EIP-721qs tokens.
